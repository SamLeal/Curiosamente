# Curiosamente


This repository contains a Swift app for conducting quizzes in the fields of geography, math, and text. The app provides an interactive platform for users to test their knowledge and improve their skills in these subjects.

The app was developed for a swift course HackaTruck.

It is currently not being developed because I no longer have acces to a plataform to develop in Swift, only had the oportunity to use a MacBook for a month.
